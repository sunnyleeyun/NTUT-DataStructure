    "A ***Gray code*** is an encoding of numbers so that two contiguous numbers have a single digit differing by 1. The term Gray code is often used to refer to a \"reflected\" code, or more specifically still, the binary reflected Gray code. For example, one-bit Gray code is $G_1=[0, 1]$ and two-bit Gray code is $G_2=[00, 01, 11, 10]$. Three-bit Gray code is as follows:\n",
